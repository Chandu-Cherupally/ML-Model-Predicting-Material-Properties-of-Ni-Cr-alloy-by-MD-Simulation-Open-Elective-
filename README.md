Author: Chandu Cherupally (22CSB0C20, CSE-A)
Project Area: Machine Learning for Material Informatics

🧠 Project Overview

This project integrates Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations with Machine Learning (ML) models to predict the mechanical properties of Nickel-Chromium (Ni–Cr) alloys.

The aim is to accelerate materials design by using ML to learn from simulation data, reducing the need for repeated computationally expensive molecular dynamics experiments.

The properties predicted include:

Young’s Modulus
Yield Strength
Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS)

⚙️ Workflow Summary
The project follows a 5-stage workflow:
Data Generation (LAMMPS Simulations)
Molecular dynamics simulations of Ni–Cr alloys are automated using Python scripts (run_simulations.py).
Each simulation outputs stress–strain data as CSV files stored in Data/raw/.

Data Processing & Feature Extraction
Raw stress–strain data are parsed using parse_outputs.py and processed into numerical features using make_features.py.
Derived quantities include UTS, yield point, and elastic modulus.

Dataset Preparation
All processed data are saved in Data/processed/mechanical_properties.csv and split into individual .joblib datasets for each target variable.

Model Training and Evaluation
Multiple regression models are trained using train_models.py:

Linear Regression
Ridge Regression
Random Forest Regressor
Multi-Layer Perceptron (Neural Network)
Performance is measured using MAE, RMSE, and R² score.

Visualization & Result Analysis
Feature importance and performance plots are generated (plot_results.py), showing the predictive capability of each model.

📊 Machine Learning Models
| Model                 | Description                      | Strengths                          |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Linear Regression** | Simple baseline regression model | Interpretable coefficients         |
| **Ridge Regression**  | Linear model with regularization | Reduces overfitting                |
| **Random Forest**     | Ensemble of decision trees       | High accuracy & feature importance |
| **MLP Regressor**     | Neural network-based model       | Captures nonlinear relationships   |
Each property (Young’s modulus, yield strength, UTS) is modeled independently.
